  To be noticed in an extremely saturated environment like web development I believe that your brand becomes very important.  It’s the reason that the site [www.rhysbower.com](http://www.rhysbower.com) exits along with this blog.  The more people that see me as a knowledgeable person in the industry the more likely I am to gain clients.  Both my portfolio and blog are designed to showcase the best of my work and convince prospective clients that I am the right person for the job.

**How to build your brand?**

1) Website

Your website will become your online identity.  It’s the first thing people will find when they search for you or your services (if it isn't you need to work on SEO). The saying never judge a book by its cover is often said but rarely applied so make sure the your website is the best possible version of you.

2) Email

Email is still the predominant method of communication when connection with new people.  It's the one platform that you can expect everyone to be one. Because of this you should take the time to get email setup at your domain.  It won’t cost much, around $5 a month for Google Apps, but will improve the first impression of your business.

**So what should I do?**

When you are starting out consider the little things that help you look professional. Usually they aren’t very expensive and once you have them setup you can forget about some of them. Make sure that the content at the surface of your site has a wow factor that pull them further into your content. Further, provide a way for visitors to contact you when they have found something interesting. Make sure that your communication pathways are open so that visitors  can contact you in the methods that work best for them.

Lets hope that this advice turns out to be good.  If it isn’t I’m sorry and I write this up this blog as a failed marketing scheme.  But don’t worry I will keep you posted about my further brand building process. I really do hope this works.
