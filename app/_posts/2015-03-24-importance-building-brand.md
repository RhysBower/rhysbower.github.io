  To be noticed in an extremely saturated environment like web development I believe that your brand becomes very important.  It’s the reason that the site www.rhysbower.com exists along with this blog.  The more people that see me as a knowledgeable person in the industry the more likely I am to gain clients.  Both my portfolio and blog are designed to showcase the best of my work and convince prospective clients that I am the right person for the job.

To be noticed in an extremely saturated environment like web development I believe that your brand becomes very important.  It’s the reason that the site [www.rhysbower.com](http://www.rhysbower.com/) exists along with this blog.  The more people that see me as a knowledgeable person in the industry the more likely I am to gain clients.  Both my [portfolio]({{ site.url }}/portfolio/) and [blog](http://www.rhysbower.com) are designed to showcase the best of my work and convince prospective clients that I am the right person for the job.

**How to build your brand?**

1) Website

Your website will become your online identity.  It’s the first thing people will find when they search for you or your services (if it isn't you need to work on SEO like me). It's often said to "never judge a book by its cover" but rarely applied so make sure the your website is the best possible version of you. This is the reason that I am constantly iterating on the design of the site.

I am using [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to automate most of the build process except the actual push to the live site. As my site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) my production site is versioned through git so a simple copy of the site to the master branch followed by a `git push` gives you all of my latest changes.

2) Email

Email is still the predominant method of communication when connection with new people.  It's the one platform that you can expect everyone to be on. Because of this you should take the time to get email setup at your domain. Currently I am still evaluating the different service providers before I make my decision.

**So what should I do?**

When you are starting out consider the little things that help you look professional. Usually they aren’t very expensive and once you have them setup you can forget about some of them. Make sure that the content at the surface of your site has a wow factor that pull your readers further into your content.

Ensure that you provide a way for visitors to contact you when they have found something interesting. Make sure that your communication pathways are open so that visitors can contact you in the methods that work best for them.

Lets hope that this advice turns out to be correct and helps me grow my site.  If you have any suggestions for me send me a tweet [@BowerRhys](http://www.twitter.com/BowerRhys) and I'll be sure to get back to you.
