  My site has site has now been online for over two months and recently I began to evaluate the software that I use to publish the content. The goal is to update the site more frequently.  To do this I have to make updating the site as frictionless as possible so that there are no excuses for not posting.

My site has site has now been online for over two months and recently I began to evaluate the software that I use to publish the content. The goal is to update the site more frequently.  To do this I have to make updating the site as frictionless as possible so that there are no excuses for not posting.

This blog is powered by something that many of you probably would not guess unless you have read some of my previous posts. I use Jekyll to build the site, a static site generator. Jekyll takes the source of my site and compiles it into the static HTML pages that are served to your web browser. Well actually I have a build process that automates all of this and Jekyll is only part of the build. I love using Jekyll due to my programming background. However it has big downsides that I have been thinking about a lot lately, mainly comments.

As Jekyll is a static site generator it inherently has limitations as to what types of dynamic content you can include on your pages. While services like Disqus do exist as a great solution for on site commenting I would like to control all of the users interactions on my site. It is for this reason that I have been considering switching to Wordpress. With Wordpress I will be able to add comments, start a mailing list, and increase the interactions I have with visitors.

The main reason that I am still using Jekyll is because of how easy it is to edit the theme and layout of the site. I am not looking forward to learning all of the crazy internals of Wordpress but now might be the time. Wordpress is insanely popular and there is so much web design work available for designers and developers. At the same time Wordpress opens up the doors to many great plugins that can make running your website more enjoyable. I am really looking forward to editing in the browser from any computer. Hopefully, with this I will be able to update my site more frequently and create more interesting content for you, the readers.
