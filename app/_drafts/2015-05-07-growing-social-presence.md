I haven't been in business for that long, only a few months. However during that time I have learned so much about what it takes to become an entrepreneur. It takes time and a brand. The first things that prospective clients ask me about are:

1. How long have you been working?
2. What are your past projects?

These are very hard question to answer for someone who doesn't have a large well known brand with lots of past projects. This severely limits the kinds of clients that I can attract. What I have found is that I am limited to small (usually single person projects) that have an equally small budget.

The big question I have been contemplating is how much is my time worth in relation to my portfolio. Is it better to work for less money to get another project on your portfolio or should you pass on small contracts.

I think that the answer is very clear. You need the work, so take what you can get. However I would still like the client to appreciate and realize the true value of the services that I provide. Think of it like the good thing to do for you fellow entrepreneurs out there as a way to reduce the number of people looking for free services in the future.
